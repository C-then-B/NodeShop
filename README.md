# NodeShop
Simple Online Shop with Node.js backend - written in Typescript

NodeShop is a small project to get me accustomed to node and the npm ecosystem.
It is written in Typescript and uses Postgresql for storage.

To run, install node as well as Postgresql. Fork & set your Postgresql details in the .env file.
If you prefer a different method or to hardcode your login details (not recommended) you will have to recompile with tsc from the included source.
